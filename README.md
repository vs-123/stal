# stal
A stack-based interpreted language

the neat thing about this is that it doesn't really need a parser due to the language's grammar.

## Example
The following code creates a variable called `greeting` and assigns string `"Hello World"` to it, and then the variable is printed.

```
greeting "Hello World" =
greeting print
```
